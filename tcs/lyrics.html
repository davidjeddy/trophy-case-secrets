oh, to be with you....in this night and forever
Inside these voices ring.....and I , want to make you happy
It's breaking me
These roads are tied down
And she's gone with you
Did she want it this way?
Was it hard to hear her say
That it seems like it's all for nothing
Nothing at all.....Nothing at all
Tonight, she's there with you
In your arms
Where she'll be forever </font></td>

Begging for reasons just to stay All these forgetful reminders drifting away It's not forever anymore Tomorrow will kiss the tears fallen like before .....you were here It's over, you're leaving tonight Wont be back in my arms again It's not forever anymore And this nightmare turned over is you How you walked right out of our life Kiss the tears fallen out of sight Memories fading as they will Tears from the distance that kills me standing still Walking through nowhere feels empty without you here The corners of downtown and somewhere in the clear.....you weren't there </font></td>

Dreams with all your memories It's getting hard to see you face It's been three weeks since we have spoken words Or exchanged these glances But oh to be with you 
And live my life by the colors of your eyes And feel the laughter in your smile All alone I'm wasting time away And I see your picture I take back the words that we recited over and over All alone I'm wasting time away Will I see your face tonight? 
Well here's to your "new found love" Love can take you by the shoulders And turn you around to let yourself go Reminds of times where we were younger But not so young that we could not feel love The love that pushed me from you further every day Regret so softly kissed my cheek

you're only here for the ride I guess this means the nightmare is over or has it just begun and you know that I'd sacrifice anything for you just let me be the one that you you come running to I want you to fall in love again as crazy as it all may seem I'm willing to give up everything just to be with you if you're eager to go then I guess there's nothing I can do to stop you and you know that I'd do anything for you and I want to be the one who's in your arms I want you to fall in love again as crazy as it all may seem I'm willing to give up everything just to be with you

you have no idea why I'm sitting here so satisfied when I could make my whole life break I'll let you guess again at this little game we play and maybe you will guess right this time I will fight for all you're worth I will listen when you talk I will cry when you are sad just let me be the best friend you ever had just sit here a little longer before you go and I won't ask anything from you I'm tired as it is so I don't want to fight about whether or not my love is good enough I will fight for all you're worth I will listen when you talk I will cry when you are sad just let me be the best friend you ever had I'm not leaving right away I will stay as long as you need me to stay and I'll miss you when you're gone b/c you're the best friend I ever had
